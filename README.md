## Roles

Each intern team plays one of the following:

| Role          | Objective                                      | Tools / Signals                        |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Market Maker  | Quote fairly and manage inventory risk        | Product-specific, delta hedging allowed |
| Hedge Fund    | Exploit vol regime shifts & implied/realized edge | Delayed vol signal, full product access |
| Arbitrage Desk| Trade mispriced spreads between SPX/SPY       | Tracking signal, fast execution         |
| Retail Trader | (Employees only) Add flow and realism         | No signal, limited trade size           |
