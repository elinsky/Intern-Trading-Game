# Intern Trading Game: Overview

## Game Objective

Create a realistic, role-based market simulation where each intern team acts as a trading desk. Teams develop automated trading strategies, compete on role-specific performance metrics, and gain hands-on experience in quantitative trading.

## What You'll Build

Each team develops a trading bot that:

- Connects to the market simulation
- Analyzes real-time market data and signals
- Executes trades based on your strategy
- Manages risk within role constraints

## Market Structure

The game simulates two correlated underlyings with options:

| Instrument | Description | Key Features |
|------------|-------------|--------------|
| **SPX** | S&P 500 Index | High-dollar value, moderate volatility |
| **SPY** | S&P 500 ETF | Tracks SPX with noise and lag |
| **Options** | European calls/puts | ~5 strikes, 2-3 expirations per underlying |

## How It Works

The market operates with **continuous trading** throughout the day:

1. **9:30 AM - Opening Rotation**: Batch auction determines opening prices
2. **9:30 AM - 3:00 PM - Continuous Trading**:
   - Submit orders anytime
   - Immediate order matching
   - Real-time position updates
3. **Throughout the Day**:
   - Underlying prices update continuously
   - News events occur randomly (1-4 hours apart)
   - Role-specific signals provided in real-time

## Choose Your Role

Each team is assigned one trading role with unique advantages and constraints:

| Role | Strategy Focus | Key Advantage | Main Challenge |
|------|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Market Maker** | Provide liquidity | +$0.02 maker rebates | Must quote 80% uptime |
| **Hedge Fund** | Gamma trading | Advance vol signals | Â±50 delta neutrality |
| **Arbitrage Desk** | SPX-SPY convergence | Tracking error signals | Maintain paired trades |
