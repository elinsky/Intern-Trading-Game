## 1. Role Details

- **Signal Access**: None.
- **Fees/Incentives**:
  - **Enhanced Maker Rebate**: +\$0.02 per filled side.
  - **Reduced Taker Fee**: -\$0.01 per contract.
  - **Competitive Advantage**: Enhanced fee structure vs. other roles (+\$0.02 maker vs. +\$0.01 for HF/Arb).
- **Constraints**:
  - Must quote ≥ 80 % of instruments across BOTH SPX and SPY each tick.
  - Inventory limits: Maximum ±50 net contracts per product (SPX/SPY).
  - Must provide two-sided quotes (bid and ask) on each instrument.

  - **Quote Coverage**: Percentage of required instruments quoted (must be ≥ 80%)
  - **Inventory Penalty**: Deduction for positions exceeding ±50 limit

## 2. Advantages

- **Guaranteed Flow**: Always in the market with posted quotes for consistent spread capture.
- **Superior Fee Structure**: Enhanced maker rebates (+\$0.02) and reduced taker fees (-\$0.01) provide significant cost advantage.
- **Direct Competition**: Both MMs compete on same products, driving innovation and efficiency.
- **Inventory Control**: Can hedge to stay within position limits and minimize risk.
- **Predictable Edge**: Profits primarily from capturing the bid-ask spread.
- **Competition Dynamics**: While competing with another MM, the enhanced fee structure provides sustainable profitability.

## 3. Disadvantages

- **No Signal Edge**: Must infer volatility/direction from market data and retail flow.
- **Obligation to Quote**: ≥ 80 % coverage forces participation, even in adverse conditions.
- **MM vs MM Competition**: Direct competition with another Market Maker can compress spreads.
- **Dual Product Obligation**: Must maintain quotes on both SPX and SPY products simultaneously.

## 4. How to Make Money

1. **Capture the Spread**
   - Post bid below fair value, ask above fair value
   - When both sides fill, you profit the spread difference
   - Enhanced rebates (+$0.02) boost profitability on every fill

2. **Leverage Fee Advantage**
   - You get +$0.02 maker rebate vs +$0.01 for others
   - Pay only -$0.01 taker fee vs -$0.02 for others
   - This $0.01-0.03 edge per contract adds up quickly

3. **Manage Inventory Risk**
   - Stay within ±50 net position limit per product
   - Skew quotes to push inventory back toward neutral
   - Use the underlying to hedge when needed

4. **Quote Smart, Not Wide**
   - Tighter spreads attract more volume (more rebates)
   - But spreads must cover adverse selection risk
   - Balance volume vs risk for optimal profitability

## 5. Suggested Strategies

- **Dynamic Spread Sizing**: Widen spreads when volatility increases or inventory builds
- **Retail Flow Focus**: Retail orders often cross the spread - your fee advantage makes these profitable
- **Quote Skewing**: If long 30 contracts, lower your offers and raise your bids to reduce position
- **Cross-Product Balance**: Monitor combined SPX+SPY exposure, not just individual products
- **Compete on Volume**: Your fee edge means you can quote tighter than the other MM and still profit
