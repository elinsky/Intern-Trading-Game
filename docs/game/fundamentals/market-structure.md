# Market Structure

## Tradable Instruments

### Underlyings

The game features two correlated equity indices:

| Instrument | Type  | Typical Price | Volatility | Key Features                     |
| ---------- | ----- | ------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------- |
| **SPX**    | Index | ~4,400        | Moderate   | S&P 500 Index, high dollar value |
| **SPY**    | ETF   | ~440          | Moderate   | Tracks SPX/10 with noise and lag |

### Correlation Model

SPY is designed to track SPX with imperfections:

- Base correlation: ~0.98
- Tracking error: 0.1-0.3% daily
- Lag: 1-2 ticks
- Additional noise component

This creates arbitrage opportunities between the two products.

  - ATM area: 4290, 4400, 4510
  - Upside: 4620, 4840, 5060, 5280, 5500, 5720
- Similar proportional coverage for SPY
