class OrderValidationService(OrderValidationServiceInterface):
    """Service for validating trading orders and cancellation requests.

    This service handles all order validation logic including constraint
    checking for new orders and ownership verification for cancellations.
    It owns and manages rate limiting state internally, providing thread-safe
    order rate tracking for the multi-threaded architecture.

    The service enforces trading rules such as position limits, order
    rate limits, and role-specific constraints to ensure fair and
    orderly market operations.

    Parameters
    ----------
    validator : ConstraintBasedOrderValidator
        The order validator configured with role-specific constraints
    exchange : ExchangeVenue
        The exchange venue for executing cancellation operations
    get_positions_func : callable
        Function to retrieve current positions for a team
        Signature: (team_id: str) -> Dict[str, int]

    Attributes
    ----------
    validator : ConstraintBasedOrderValidator
        The order validator instance
    exchange : ExchangeVenue
        The exchange venue instance
    _get_positions : callable
        Position retrieval function
    orders_this_second : Dict[str, int]
        Internal order count tracking per team (thread-safe)
    orders_lock : threading.RLock
        Lock for thread-safe access to order counts

    Notes
    -----
    The service owns rate limiting state internally while accessing
    position state through injected functions. This design enables:

    1. Thread-safe operation with internal locking for rate limits
    2. Service ownership of validation-related state
    3. Clear separation of concerns between services

    The validation process builds a complete context including current
    positions and order counts before applying configured constraints.

    TradingContext
    --------------
    Order validation enforces critical trading constraints:

    - Position limits: Prevent excessive risk exposure (e.g., Â±50)
    - Order rate limits: Prevent system abuse and ensure fairness
    - Price validation: Ensure limit orders have reasonable prices
    - Role restrictions: Enforce role-specific trading rules

    Cancellation requests require ownership verification to prevent
    market manipulation through unauthorized cancellations.

        the team's current positions and order activity.

        Parameters
        ----------

            The order to validate, containing instrument, side,

        Notes
        -----
        The validation process:
        1. Retrieves current team positions and order count
        2. Builds a ValidationContext with complete state
        3. Applies all configured constraints via the validator

        required state through the injected functions.

        TradingContext
        --------------
        Validation must complete quickly (<1ms) to maintain low
        latency order processing. Common validation scenarios:

        - Market makers hitting position limits during active quoting
        - Teams exceeding order rate limits during volatile markets
        - Invalid prices outside reasonable bands for limit orders
        - Role-specific restrictions on certain instruments

        The validation result includes detailed error messages to
        help trading algorithms adjust their behavior appropriately.

        Parameters
        ----------
        order_id : str
            The exchange-assigned order ID to cancel

            The ID of the team requesting cancellation

        Tuple[bool, Optional[str]]
            A tuple containing:

            - reason: Optional[str] with failure reason if applicable

        Notes
        -----
        The cancellation process delegates to the exchange, which:
        1. Verifies the order exists and is cancellable
        2. Confirms ownership matches the requesting team
        3. Removes the order from the order book if valid
        4. Returns success/failure indication

        Failure reasons include:
        - Order not found (never existed or already filled)
        - Unauthorized (order belongs to different team)
        - Order already filled or partially filled

        TradingContext
        --------------
        Cancellation timing is critical in fast-moving markets:

        - Orders may fill between submission and cancellation
        - Partial fills may occur, leaving residual quantities
        - Race conditions are inherent and must be handled gracefully

        Teams should implement robust error handling for failed
        cancellations and track their outstanding orders carefully
        to avoid confusion about order states.
