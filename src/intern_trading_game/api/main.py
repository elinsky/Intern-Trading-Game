def websocket_thread():

    This thread bridges the synchronous trading threads with the asynchronous
    WebSocket connections. It receives messages from other threads via a
    thread-safe queue and broadcasts them to connected clients based on
    team ID and message type.

    The thread runs an asyncio event loop to handle WebSocket operations,
    using asyncio.to_thread to safely retrieve messages from the synchronous
    queue without blocking the event loop.

    Message flow:
    1. Trading threads put messages on websocket_queue
    2. This thread retrieves messages asynchronously
    3. Messages are routed to appropriate WebSocket broadcast methods
    4. Connected clients receive real-time updates

    Notes
    -----
    The thread uses a None sentinel value in the queue to signal shutdown,
    allowing graceful termination during API shutdown.

    Messages are only sent to connected clients - disconnected clients are
    silently skipped to prevent blocking the queue.

    The thread handles all WebSocket message types:
    - new_order_ack: Order accepted by exchange
    - new_order_reject: Order failed validation
    - execution_report: Trade executed
    - position_snapshot: Current positions on connect

    TradingContext
    --------------
    In production, this thread would also handle:
    - Market data updates (bid/ask changes)
    - News events and signals
    - System announcements
    - Heartbeat messages for connection health

    Examples
    --------
    Message format in queue:
    >>> websocket_queue.put((
    ...     'new_order_ack',  # message type
    ...     'TEAM_001',       # team_id
    ...     {                 # data dict
    ...         'order_id': 'ORD_123',
    ...         'client_order_id': 'MY_ORDER_1',

    ----------

        Team's API key provided as query parameter (?api_key=...)

    Notes

    Connection lifecycle:

    The connection uses query parameter authentication because WebSocket
    headers are not consistently supported across all client libraries.
