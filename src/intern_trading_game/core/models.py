class Signal:
    """Role-specific advance information for eligible strategies.

    Represents predictive signals distributed by the Event System

    role type as configured in game parameters.

    Parameters
    ----------
    signal_type : str
        Type of signal ("volatility" or "tracking_error")
    tick_horizon : int

        Signal-specific data payload
    accuracy : float
        Configured accuracy rate for this signal type

    Notes
    -----
    Volatility signals contain transition probabilities:
    - P(Low), P(Medium), P(High) summing to 1.0

    Tracking error signals contain:
    - Expected deviation magnitude and direction

    TradingContext
    --------------
    Market Assumptions
        - Signals represent probabilistic forecasts
        - Accuracy reflects long-run hit rate
        - No guarantee on individual predictions

    Trading Rules
        - Hedge funds receive volatility signals
        - Arbitrage desks receive tracking signals
        - Market makers receive no advance signals

    Represents significant market events generated by the Event

    Parameters
    ----------
    event_id : str
        Unique identifier for this event
    event_type : str
        Category: "regime_shift", "price_jump", "false_signal"
    description : str
        Human-readable event description
    impact_magnitude : float
        Size of potential market impact
    tick_announced : int
        When event becomes public

    Notes
    -----
    Event generation follows Poisson process with configurable
    rate (typically Î»=1 per 1-4 hours). Event type probabilities
    are configurable in game parameters.

    TradingContext
    --------------
    Market Assumptions
        - News reflects real market conditions
        - Impact varies with current volatility
        - Market digests news over multiple ticks

    Trading Rules
        - All players see news simultaneously
        - Some roles get advance warning via signals

class GameConfig:

    Defines the operational parameters that control game timing,

    consistent gameplay across all participants.

    Parameters
    ----------
    session_name : str
        Unique identifier for this game session
    tick_duration_seconds : int, default=300
        Duration of each tick in seconds (5 minutes)
    trading_days : List[str], default=["Tuesday", "Thursday"]
        Days of week when trading occurs
    market_open : time, default=time(9, 30)
        Market opening time in CT (Central Time)
    market_close : time, default=time(15, 0)
        Market closing time in CT
    total_ticks : int, default=390
        Total ticks in a session (65 per day * 6 days)
    enable_volatility_events : bool, default=True
        Whether to generate volatility regime changes
    enable_news_events : bool, default=True
        Whether to generate market news events
    bot_timeout_seconds : float, default=10.0
        Maximum time allowed for bot response

    Attributes
    ----------
    ticks_per_hour : int
        Calculated as 3600 / tick_duration_seconds
    ticks_per_day : int
        Calculated based on market hours

    Notes
    -----
    Standard market hours (9:30 AM - 3:00 PM CT) provide 5.5 hours
    of trading time, which at 5-minute ticks yields:

    $\\text{ticks per day} = \\frac{5.5 \\times 60}{5} = 66$

    We use 65 ticks to account for opening/closing procedures.

    Bot timeout ensures game clock stability - strategies that exceed
    the timeout receive no orders for that tick.

    TradingContext
    --------------
    Market Assumptions
        - Consistent tick timing ensures fair play
        - All strategies operate under same schedule
        - Market hours reflect equity market standards

    Trading Rules
        - No trading outside defined market hours
        - Tick duration cannot be modified mid-session
        - Bots must respond within timeout or forfeit turn

    Examples
    --------
    >>> config = GameConfig(
