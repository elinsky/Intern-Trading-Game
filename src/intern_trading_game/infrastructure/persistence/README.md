# Persistence Infrastructure

This directory is reserved for future database integration as part of the v4 architecture.

## Planned Contents:
- `repositories/` - Repository pattern implementations
- `database.py` - Database connection and session management
- `migrations/` - Database schema migrations

Currently, all state is managed in-memory by services. This structure prepares for future persistence needs without requiring immediate implementation.
