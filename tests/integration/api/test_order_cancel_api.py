def test_websocket_cancel_flow():

    Given - Client connected via WebSocket
    A trading bot maintains persistent WS connection.
    They need real-time updates on order status.

    When - Cancel processed
    Order cancellation flows through the system.

    Then - Client receives ORDER_CANCEL_ACK message
    WebSocket message delivered promptly.
    Contains order_id and status confirmation.
    Bot can update internal state accordingly.
    """
    # This test requires WebSocket client setup
    # Would test the full async flow
    pass  # Requires WebSocket test client


# Additional test ideas:
# - Cancel during different tick phases
# - Cancel with client_order_id reference
# - Bulk cancel functionality (future)
# - Cancel impact on order counts/limits
